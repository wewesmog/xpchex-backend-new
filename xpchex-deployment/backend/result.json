Mask the account balance on the send money page. 2. Enable Lipa na M-Pesa (Buy Goods - Safaricom) functionality. 3. Add a prompt feature to request money from any M-Pesa number, similar to the deposit prompt. 4. The \"Fund My Card\" option hasn't worked for meâ€”please check if it's a wider issue.",
